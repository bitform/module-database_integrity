## module-database_integrity

This module was written to help debug problems that arise with Form Tools. The module provides you with a couple of quick, simple tests to run on your database. This is well, well worth doing: in the very least to confirm that the problems you're encountering are not due to a corrupt database.

*Please note:* this module is deprecated. Please check out the [System Check](https://github.com/formtools/module-system_check) module for a newer version. That contains a superset of the functionality offered by this module.
